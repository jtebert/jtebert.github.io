    <h2>Suture Score</h2>
    <h4>Python, Ruby, Matlab, Javascript</h4>
    <p>Suture Score is an application to provide instant, objective feedback on suturing technique to surgical trainees. To prepare for assessments and surgery, students need as much practice as possible. Using innovative image recognition techniques, Suture Score aims to enhance trainees' practice to improve their suturing skills. Suture Score was created at the NHS-sponsored TELHack hackathon, where it won first place.</p>
