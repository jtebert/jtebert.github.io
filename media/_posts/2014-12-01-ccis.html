    <p>Becca MacKenzie and Julia Ebert love to program. But they also remember how it felt to be new to coding. That’s why the Northeastern University undergraduates volunteered this fall to teach a class introducing high school students to programming...</p>
    <p>Together, they developed the two-part, three-hour “Code It!” class that invited high school students to learn programming basics and create their own programs using the Python language. Ebert says, “We had free rein to design a class that would be interesting and meaningful. We used online resources as a starting point, adapted them for a high school audience, and then based the content on our experiences as teaching assistants and what we thought would be fun and interesting to cover.”</p>
