<h4>2014 November 25</h4>
<p>"The University Scholars & Office of Fellowships is pleased to announce that Julia Ebert, a Northeastern University senior, has been awarded a Marshall Scholarship. Funded by the British government to commemorate the Marshall Plan and the special relationship between the United Kingdom and the United States, the Marshall Scholarship allows 40 "intellectually distinguished young Americans, their country's future leaders, to study in the UK" each year. Fewer than 3% of the over 900 applicants endorsed by their universities earn this prestigious and highly competitive award."</p>
