Codecademy has lessons and projects for many programming languages, including Python. We've covered the start of the Python exercises. Keep learning more Python or try a new language!

#### [Code.org](http://code.org/)
Resources and projects for learning a variety of fun programming basics, including making your own games and apps.

#### [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/)
Documentation tells you about what a programming language can, what functions it has, and how to use them. The documentation for Python contains everything you'll want to know about Python.

#### [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
If you get stuck and Google isn't helping, check out StackOverflow. Searching here can often give more useful results than Google. And if you don't find what you're looking for, you can submit a question and experienced programmers can help you out!

# Keep Coding!

### Try it at school
Check if your school offers a programming or computer science course, or if there is a club to join.

### Make your own project
You'll have more fun programming and learn more when you're working on a project you want to do. Codecademy has some ideas, but you can also take inspiration from existing apps, programs, games, or anything you think could be made cooler or easier with programming.

### projecteuler.net
Project Euler has hundreds of cool problems to solve using programming. Put your skills to use and keep them fresh by solving interesting math problems.
