    <h2>Cooperative Exoskeleton Control for Human Balance Recovery</h2>
    <h3>Imperial College London, Human Robotics Group</h3>
    <h4>Advisors: Professor Etienne Burdet, Dr. Ildar Farkhatdinov</h4>
    <p>Maintaining balance in the face of perturbations is essential to walking and standing. For my masters thesis, I am developing controls for the LOPES exoskeleton (LOwer-extremity Powered ExoSkeleton, University of Twente) to assist humans with balance recovery after perturbations, using a combination of feed-forward and feedback control (such as hip torques and a PD controller). I am also developing a model of the coupled human-robot system in Simulink to develop and test controls before implementation on LOPES.</p>
