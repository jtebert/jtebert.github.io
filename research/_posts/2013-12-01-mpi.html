<h2>Dimensionality Reduction in Motor Learning</h2>

<h4>Advisor: Professor Stefan Schaal</h4>
<p>While many studies have investigated learning to control the redundant high dimensionality of the joint space of the human body, years of experience make such tasks only adaptations of a highly trained system.</p>
<p>The CyberGlove measures 19 joint angles in the hand and provides a novel environment for learning to control high dimensionality.  Subjects learn to control a cursor in 2 dimensions through a mapping from the 19 dimensions of the hand.  We plan to model this learning to investigate the learning process and understand the structure of exploration in motor learning.</p>
