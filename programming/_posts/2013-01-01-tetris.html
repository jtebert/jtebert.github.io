<h2>Tetris</h2>
<h4>Racket</h4>
<p>This was a Racket (Scheme) project for the Computer Science Fundamentals course used in previous semesters. I decided to do it anyway. It is a fully functional Tetris clone, including scoring and levels. (The code is not posted on my GitHub in case the project is used again for the class.)</p>
<p>To run the game, make sure that "Allow executing file as program" is checked in the file's permissions.</p>
