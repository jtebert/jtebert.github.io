    <h2>Tetris</h2>
    <h4>Racket</h4>
    <p>This was a Racket (Scheme) project for the Computer Science Fundamentals course used in previous semesters. I decided to do it anyway. It is a fully functional Tetris clone, including scoring and levels. (The code is not posted on my GitHub in case the project is used again for the class.)</p>
