    <h2>VROOM: Vacuum Robot Overcoming Obstacles and Messes</h2>
    <h4>Python</h4>
    <p>VROOM was a final project for an artificial intelligence course. It is a simulated robotic vacuum cleaner designed to explore its environment, classify the types of obstacles it encounters, and plan an efficient path to clean dirt in expected locations. It makes use of many classical AI algorithms such as A* search and naive Bayes classification.</p>
