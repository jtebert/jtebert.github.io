    <h2>Bimanual Learning and Retention</h2>
    <h3>Northeastern University Action Lab</h3>
    <h4>Advisor: Professor Dagmar Sternad</h4>
    <p>Asymmetric bimanual tasks, such as eating with a knife and fork, are common in everyday life, but they have received significantly less attention than unimanual or symmetric bimanual tasks in motor neuroscience.</p>
    <p>In the current study, subjects learn a bimanual task over 20 days and retun after 3 months to test retention.  Participants perform a task in which they move their right arm sinusoidally to a metronome beat while making rapid discrete point-to-point reaching movements with the left arm on a randomly timed cue.  Preliminary results suggest an asymmetry in the learning; in bimanual conditions, subjects demonstrated increased speed with the left arm, but were unable to attenuate the perturbation this caused in the right arm, an effect that persists after the break interval.</p>
    <p>Plans for future research include investigating neural correlates of the observed asymmetry, possibly with electroencephalography (EEG) or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS).</p>
